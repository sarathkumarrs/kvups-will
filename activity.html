                <div><h4>KALLARA- PANGODE FEST</h4></div>
                <p>The programmes as a part of the annual celebrations 
                    of the school in 2000 was later adopted by the development
                    committee & natives and is now known as Kallara- Pangode 
                    fest or as “Magical Fest in the historical world”, is a 
                    famous regional cultural fest. From the last fifteen years 
                    after the mid summer exams the one week long fest begins 
                    with the PTA meetings. Thousands of people including the 
                    former students ,natives ,parents and students get together
                    for the cultural fest. Programmes of students , parents and 
                    other artists are held on the main stage whereas exhibitions
                    ,book fest , agricultural and industrial exhibitions and 
                    trade , amusement park,flower show etc are also arranged. 
                    We consider the fest as an opportunity to reveal the 
                    excellency of the school, the artistic and cultural 
                    skills of the students in front of the public. 
                    The school which faced a threat of closure is 
                    now excelling with more than 500 students in 
                    the UP level and survives as an example of the
                        concept that schools and society are one and 
                        society adopts school.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We have arranged several study tours via flight,train,ship,bus etc. 
                    we are the first to organise study tour by airlines for the 
                    students in the rural village in kerala. We have conducted 
                    study tour for about thrice in airlines. It was a memorable 
                    experience for the students who never get an opportunity to 
                    travel through sea and train. Journey by train are unforgettable 
                    experience for the students. We arrange regional field trips and
                    one day tours at low expense for those students who are economically backward.
